# Express.js Route Handler Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling. The `bug.js` file shows a route that attempts to fetch a user by ID, but fails to gracefully handle cases where the ID is invalid or the user is not found.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling.

## Bug
The original code lacks error handling when parsing the user ID or when a user with the given ID is not found.

## Solution
The solution adds comprehensive error handling to address potential issues, making the route more robust and preventing unexpected crashes or incorrect responses.
